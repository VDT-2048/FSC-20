# FSC-20 dataset
We constructed a large-scale few-shot classification dataset named FSC-20(few-shot classification contains 20 types of strip steel surface defects). This dataset was collected from the three datasets the NEU-CLS, the X-SDD, and the GC10-DET, with a total of 20 categories. Specifically, it includes 10 types of cold-rolled defects (all from GC10-DET) and 10 types of hot-rolled defects (6 types from NEU-CLS and the other 4 types from X-SDD).

# FaNet
We propose a feature-aware network (FaNet) for a few shot defect classification, which can effectively distinguish new classes with a small number of labeled samples.
